## Features

This calculator provides the following functionalities:

* **Addition (`+`)**: Sums two numbers.
* **Subtraction (`-`)**: Finds the difference between two numbers.
* **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
* **Division (`/`)**: Divides two numbers, with **robust handling for division by zero**.
* **Continuous Operations**: Allows users to perform multiple calculations in a single session without restarting the program.
* **Graceful Exit**: Users can type `exit` at any input prompt to terminate the calculator.
* **Input Validation**: Basic error handling for non-numeric inputs, ensuring the program only processes valid numbers.

## How to Run

To run this calculator on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Save the Code**:
    Save the provided Python code into a file named `calculator.py` (or any other `.py` extension).

2.  **Open Your Terminal**:
    Navigate to the directory where you saved `calculator.py` using your command prompt or terminal.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project/folder
    ```

3.  **Execute the Script**:

## Example Usage

Welcome to the Simple Python Calculator! You can perform +, -, *, / operations. Type 'exit' at any time to quit.
Enter first number (or 'exit'): 10 Enter second number: 5 Enter operator (+, -, *, /): + Result: 15.0
Enter first number (or 'exit'): 20 Enter second number: 0 Enter operator (+, -, *, /): / Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
Enter first number (or 'exit'): hello Invalid input for the first number. Please enter a valid number.
Enter first number (or 'exit'): exit
Exiting calculator. Goodbye!

## Future Enhancements (Ideas for Improvement)

Here are some ideas for how this calculator could be expanded in the future:

* **History Feature**: Store and display a history of performed calculations.
* **Advanced Operations**: Add support for more complex mathematical functions (e.g., square root, power, trigonometry).
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly experience.
* **Expression Parsing**: Allow users to input entire mathematical expressions (e.g., "2 + 3 * 4") and correctly evaluate them respecting operator precedence.
